This map was created by Riclo500. Anything not new to the wad takes its 
resources from the whodunit_fixed2.pk3, and the wdi_bigpack addons. The WDIEX 
Fireaxe and Baseball Bat are used from Zeberpal's WDIEX Mappack, but no other 
resources other than those two items are used (This was intended so the map 
would be compatable without the WDIEX mappack).

As for just about everything in the wad itself:

LESSLAG:

This less lag verison removes the following details:
-The entire outside inaccessable area
-Removes several 3D floors that weren't necessary 
-Removes much of the detail in the murderer holes
-Gets rid of a bunch of things
-Some Dynamic lights' size were lowered
-The gate shadows
-The generators in the basement
-Alot of sectors have been removed (There's more small things)

I didn't move around any items with only two exceptions:
-A stimpack in the crate room that sometimes bugged; it's now moved to the couch
-The molotov in the shed has been replaced with three bricks
-Also, you won't need the safe key to get the hidden drawer key now (Just the easter egg)

The point of this was to get rid of lag, regardless of whether or not it makes some parts of 
the map look bland.
