# whodunit
Prepper & Kaminsky Presents: Whodunit! (dev version)

Yes, the popular and lazarus murd from whodunit has found its home at Github. Here's how it works:

1. If you have a Git client, clone this respository. If you don't have a Git client, click "Download ZIP" from the right column of this page.
2. If you downloaded the ZIP, extract that into a temporary folder that you'll be able to find again.
3. Wdi_zip.cmd and answer the on-screen prompt (enter "pk3" or "pk7" and press enter) and it will compile a build of the mod.
4. Load the resulting pk3/pk7 file to run the mod.
